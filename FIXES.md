# Fixes Applied for Apify Deployment Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Description Extraction Timeout
**Problem:** The "Show more" button click was timing out because the element was outside the viewport.

**Solution:**
- Added `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` before clicking the button
- Added timeout handling with `.catch()` to prevent failures
- Changed error logging from `error` to `warning` 
- Added fallback to extract visible description if modal fails

### 2. Pagination Not Working
**Problem:** Only 18 listings (first page) were being scraped instead of the requested 100.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive logging to debug pagination
- Implemented 4 different methods to find and navigate to next page:
  1. Look for `[aria-label="Next"]` with href attribute
  2. Look for `nav a:has-text("Next")`
  3. Look for `[data-testid="pagination-next-button"]`
  4. **NEW:** Direct click on Next button and wait for navigation
- Added check to ensure next URL is different from current URL
- Added better error handling for navigation failures

### 3. Amenities Returning 0 Results
**Problem:** Amenities scraping was returning 0 results on Apify.

**Solution:**
- Added fallback selector method
- Method 1: Original selector `[id^="pdp_v3_"]` with `[id$="-row-title"]`
- Method 2: Alternative selector `[data-testid*="amenity"]` if first method returns 0 results

### 4. Reviews Returning 0 Results
**Note:** The reviews selector logic appears correct. This might be due to:
- Listings with no reviews
- Airbnb detecting automated access and blocking content
- Need to test with listings that have reviews

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with a location that has many listings (>100) to verify pagination works
2. Test with listings that have:
   - Long descriptions with "Show more" button
   - Many amenities
   - Multiple reviews
3. Monitor Apify logs for the new debug messages to understand pagination behavior

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. **If pagination still fails:**
   - Check Apify logs for the pagination debug messages
   - May need to add delays between page navigation
   - Consider using infinite scroll instead of pagination

2. **If amenities/reviews still return 0:**
   - Airbnb might be detecting the scraper
   - May need to add more realistic browser headers
   - Consider adding random delays between requests
   - May need to rotate user agents

3. **If description extraction still times out:**
   - Increase timeout from 5000ms to 10000ms
   - Add more wait time after scrolling into view
   - Consider skipping modal and using visible description only
